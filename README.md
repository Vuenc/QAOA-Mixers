# QAOA-Mixers
Experimenting with different mixer gates in a QAOA setting for the Advanced Topics Quantum Computing Seminar at TUM.

This seminar project experiments with the QAOA quantum algorithm, applied to the Max-κ-Colorable Subgraph Problem. In this problem, the goal is to make a given graph κ-colorable by removing a minimal number of edges. A QAOA mapping for this problem is described in "From the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm to a Quantum Alternating Operator Ansatz" (Hadfield, Wang, O'Gorman, Rieffel, Venturelli and Biswas, 2019).

This project aims at experimenting with different mixer gates for this problem. The project is written in the [Julia language](https://julialang.org/) and uses the [Qaintum](https://github.com/Qaintum) quantum circuit simulator.
